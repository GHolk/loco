# my script and man-page #

these files should be inside my home directory. 



## supcj.cin ##

this is a enhenced * **倉頡** 輸入法 * (cang-jia) input method table. 
many input method software in Taiwan support 
sepacify by this kind of formats. 

this table can input japenese, greece, 
and so do chinese. support many math symbol. 
i use gcin with this table. 

I'm Taiwanese! 
Taiwan is not a part of china! 
we are independent republic! 


## excutable scripts ##

those files are excutable. you can 
 `ln filename ~/.local/bin/` to excute them. 


### markdown.pl ###

An enhanced version modify from John Grubber's version. 
with many ugly perl code ;}

you can `ln markdown.pl ~/.local/bin/markdown` 
to use it. 


### obml-parser.pl ###

from [someone][] . 
maybe I will not use opera mini anymore, 
because it was bought from china. 
`ln obml-parser.pl ~/.local/bin/obml-parser` . 


### index.sh ###

this script will generate an index.html fast. 
now it can only reconize image files. 
other will be display as href. 
`ln index.sh ~/.local/bin/index` . 


## manual page ##

those files are man page, some plain text. 
i thought usefull. you can 
 `ln man-page ~/.local/man/man7/` 
to accesse eazily. 


### groff charactor ###

*i use html to write report.*
so i need some tool to rendering equation. 
i use **eqn** of **troff** . `eqn -T MathML < eqn.txt `
can genrate MathML from eqn. 

but spetial charator in troff is too odd
to remember, so I find this manual from
ubuntus forum and install it. 


### html entity ###

so do groff charactor. 
but this is done by myself;
